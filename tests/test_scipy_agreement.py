"""Cross-validate every uniform method against ``scipy.integrate.quad``.

Phase 0 of the quadrature alignment plan. ``scipy.integrate.quad`` is
QUADPACK-based adaptive quadrature with a long history of correctness;
agreement with it on canonical integrands ground-truths the library's
own adaptive control. The tests in this file pin agreement on smooth
integrands at default settings — the bar for an academic-grade
quadrature library.

For each method x each canonical integrand x each interval, the
library's reported integral must match ``scipy.integrate.quad`` to
``10 * atol`` (giving the library a small allowance over scipy's
default error). If a method's adaptive control is mistuned or its
weights are wrong, this test catches the disagreement.

When Phase 2 adds new methods (gk21, cc33, ...), this file gets new
parametrize entries automatically once the new methods register.
