"""Field-population tests for the ``max_path_change`` early-exit branch.

Phase 1's Bug B6 fix replaced the bare ``return None`` from the
early-exit branch with a populated ``IntegrationResult``. The
existing regression test in ``tests/test_bug_regressions.py`` checks
the return type and ``converged is False``, but does not verify
that the rest of the fields are actually populated. A future refactor
could quietly leave these fields as ``None`` while still passing the
existing regression test, leaving callers with a result that is shaped
correctly on paper but useless to inspect.

These tests pin the contract: every field on the early-exit
``IntegrationResult`` that has a populated counterpart on the
normal-completion path must also be populated here. Test failures
on this file would mean the early-exit branch silently lost a field
populated by some upstream refactor — exactly the kind of regression
the safety-belt is supposed to catch.

Coverage:

  * Every diagnostic field on ``IntegrationResult`` (``integral``,
    ``integral_error``, ``mesh_optimal``, ``mesh_init``, ``mesh_final``,
    ``nodes``, ``h``, ``y``, ``mesh_quadratures``, ``mesh_quadrature_errors``,
    ``error_ratios``, ``y0``) is non-None.
  * Trailing-dim coherence: every field whose last dimension is the
    integrand output dim D matches D=1 for our scalar integrand.
  * ``error_ratios`` actually shows that some steps failed (this is
    the very condition that triggered the early exit, so the
    ``error_ratios`` should reflect at least one entry > 1).
  * The early-exit IntegrationResult flips ``converged=False`` while
    leaving every other field shaped to match the normal path's
    contract.
