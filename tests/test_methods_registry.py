"""Method registry consistency tests.

Phase 5 of the quadrature alignment plan split ``methods.py`` into a
``methods/`` subpackage with one file per family (runge_kutta,
gauss_kronrod, clenshaw_curtis, interpolatory). The aggregated
``UNIFORM_METHODS`` and ``VARIABLE_METHODS`` registries are now built
in ``methods/__init__.py`` from per-family registries via dict-merge.

Risks introduced by the split:

  * A family registry could lose an entry without the aggregated
    registry's contents being checked.
  * Two families could collide on the same method name (last write wins
    silently — a method could move families with no error).
  * A method could be registered but never reachable through the public
    factory ``adaptive_quadrature(...)``.
  * The ``_get_method`` factory's clone path (uniform) and per-instance
    construction path (variable) could fall out of sync with the
    family-style each method belongs to.

This file pins all four invariants. It is a lightweight registry-shape
sanity net for any future family addition.
