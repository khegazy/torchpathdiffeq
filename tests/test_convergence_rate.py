"""Convergence-rate tests for every quadrature rule.

For an order-p quadrature rule applied to a smooth integrand on a
fixed interval with ``N`` equal panels, the global integration error
scales as ``O(N^(-p))``. Halving the panel size (doubling ``N``)
reduces the error by ``2^p``.

This test directly applies each method's tableau to ``N`` equal
panels (no adaptive control) and verifies that the empirical error
decay matches the theoretical rate. Bypassing the adaptive solver
means this test specifically certifies the rule's *order* property,
not the controller's behavior.

Phase 0 of the quadrature alignment plan.
