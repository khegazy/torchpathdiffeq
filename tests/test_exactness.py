"""Polynomial-exactness tests for every quadrature rule.

For an order-p Runge-Kutta method applied as quadrature, the rule
integrates polynomials of degree <= p-1 exactly (for an order-p ODE
method, the per-step truncation error vanishes when the integrand's
(p)-th derivative is zero, i.e. for polynomials of degree p-1).

This test directly applies each method's tableau weights to integrate
``t**d`` on the unit interval ``[0, 1]`` and compares against the
analytical truth ``1 / (d + 1)``. By bypassing the adaptive solver
loop, we isolate the rule's intrinsic polynomial exactness from any
adaptive refinement that could mask weight errors.

Two assertions per method:

  1. For ``d`` from 0 up to and including the claimed exactness, the
     rule is exact to ~1e-13 in float64.
  2. For ``d = exactness + 1``, the rule is *not* exact (catches
     "claimed exactness too high" bugs).

Variable methods are tested at multiple interior-node positions ``a``
to verify position-dependent behavior. Crucial sanity check:
``generic3`` at ``a = 1/2`` reduces to Simpson's rule (weights
``[1/6, 2/3, 1/6]``), which has exactness 3 rather than 2 — the test
encodes both the general-position bound (degree 2) and the
Simpson's-rule edge case (degree 3).

Phase 0 of the quadrature alignment plan.
