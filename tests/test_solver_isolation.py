"""Cross-solver isolation tests.

Phase 4 of the quadrature alignment plan eliminated the
``UNIFORM_METHODS`` singleton mutation hazard by having ``_get_method``
``clone()`` the canonical singleton before applying any dtype/device
mutation. These tests directly verify the isolation guarantees that
clone provides — properties the conftest safety-belt fixture
previously had to enforce externally.

Each test exercises a scenario where, prior to the fix, two solvers
would have corrupted each other's tableau values via the shared
singleton. After the fix, each solver owns its own clone and these
scenarios are independent.

Coverage these tests add to the existing suite:

  - **Sequential dtype mixing**: a float64 solver followed by a
    float32 solver of the same method must not affect the float64
    solver's tableau precision.
  - **Concurrent dtype mixing**: two solvers built at different
    dtypes used in interleaved calls.
  - **Singleton untouched**: ``UNIFORM_METHODS["dopri5"].tableau.b``
    stays at its canonical float64 values regardless of how many
    solvers are constructed at any dtype.
