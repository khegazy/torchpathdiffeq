"""Run example scripts end-to-end to catch documentation rot.

Phase 6 added two example scripts (``examples/quadrature_basics.py``
and ``examples/gradient_of_integral.py``) as user-facing tutorials.
They live outside ``tests/`` and are not exercised by the rest of
the test suite, so a future API rename or signature change could
silently break them. These tests subprocess each example and assert
non-zero output and a 0 exit code, plus a few markers to confirm the
specific scripted assertions inside each example were reached.

The examples are also useful as integration smoke tests that exercise:

  - ``integrate(f, method=..., mesh_init=..., mesh_final=...)`` (one-shot)
  - ``adaptive_quadrature(...).integrate(f, ...)`` (class API)
  - ``take_gradient=True`` autograd flow
  - ``reuse_mesh=True`` warm-start across iterations
  - the analytic-vs-autodiff consistency check (path A vs path B)
