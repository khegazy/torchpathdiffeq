# Initial Changes

At this point, you now have your torchpathdiffeq repository on GitHub and locally on your machine. Now it's time to start making some modifications.

### README

The first thing to do is update the README (`/README.md`), which should contain a user-friendly summary of what your package is all about. This can be whatever you want. Feel free to be creative!

### License

The torchpathdiffeq repository comes premade with a sample license (`/LICENSE.md`), in this case the permissive [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en). Feel free to change this for your own project or keep it as-is if you don't quite know yet.

!!! Tip

    There are *many* licenses that one can consider. A comprehensive list can be found on the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/?categories=popular-strong-community) website, but a less overwhelming route is to use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

### Code of Conduct

The torchpathdiffeq repository ships with a premade Code of Conduct (`/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) that is obtained from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Of course, you can feel free to keep or change this as you see fit, but it is often a good idea to have a code of conduct for public repositories.
