"""
Quadrature method definitions, organized by family.

Each family lives in its own submodule:

  - ``runge_kutta``: classical embedded RK pairs (adaptive_heun,
    fehlberg2, bosh3, dopri5).
  - ``gauss_kronrod``: Gauss-Kronrod pairs (gk15, gk21, gk31).
  - ``clenshaw_curtis``: Chebyshev-node nested rules (cc17, cc33, cc65).
  - ``interpolatory``: variable-node rules with weights computed from
    actual node positions (the variable-sampling family).

This ``__init__`` aggregates all family registries into the two
top-level dicts the solver consumes — ``UNIFORM_METHODS`` for
fixed-node methods and ``VARIABLE_METHODS`` for variable-node methods —
and exposes the ``_get_method`` factory used by the parallel solver.

Each method is specified by a Butcher tableau containing:

- **c** (nodes): Fractional positions within a step where the integrand
  is evaluated. ``c[0] = 0`` is the step start, ``c[-1] = 1`` is the
  step end.
- **b** (weights): Weights for combining evaluations into the integral
  estimate. The integral over one step is ``h * sum(b_i * f(t_i))``.
- **b_error**: Difference between the primary and embedded-method
  weights. The error estimate is ``h * sum(b_error_i * f(t_i))``.

There are two families of methods:

**Uniform methods** (``UNIFORM_METHODS``): The tableau ``c`` values are
fixed constants. Quadrature points within each step are always at the
same fractional positions regardless of step size. Simple and efficient.

**Variable methods** (``VARIABLE_METHODS``): The tableau ``b`` weights
are recomputed dynamically based on the actual positions of the
quadrature points (the ``c`` values). This allows quadrature points to
be at arbitrary positions within each step, which is useful when
refining the mesh by inserting new points between existing ones.

    Retrieve and initialize an integration method by name and sampling type.

    Each solver gets its OWN copy of the method's tableau. The
    ``UNIFORM_METHODS`` dict holds canonical singletons at float64,
    and we ``clone()`` them here so that downstream dtype/device
    mutations stay isolated to one solver instance. Without this
    cloning, two solvers running concurrently — or sequentially with
    different dtypes — would corrupt each other's tableau values
    (most notably, lower-precision conversions of the singleton are
    irreversible).

    Variable methods are constructed fresh per-solver too (they
    already manage their own per-instance state).

    Args:
        sampling_type: Whether to use uniform or variable sampling.
        method_name: Name of the method (e.g. 'dopri5',
            'interpolatory3_variable').
        device: Device to place the method's tensors on.
        dtype: Floating-point dtype for the method's tensors.

    Returns:
        An initialized method object with tensors on the correct
        device/dtype, independent of any other solver instance.
