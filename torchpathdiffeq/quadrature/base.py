"""
Parallel adaptive-stepsize integration solvers.

This module contains the core parallel integration engine. Unlike traditional
sequential integrators that must evaluate one step at a time (because each step
depends on the previous result), this solver evaluates many integration steps
simultaneously in a batch. This is possible because the integrand f(x) depends
only on x, not on accumulated state -- each step's contribution to the integral
is independent and can be computed in parallel.

The integration domain [mesh_init, mesh_final] is divided by "barriers" into steps.
Within each step, C quadrature points are placed (per the RK tableau). The
solver adaptively refines this mesh: steps with too much error are split into
smaller steps; consecutive steps with very little error are merged.

Key concepts:

- **mesh**: Boundary points dividing [mesh_init, mesh_final] into steps.
  Shape: [M, T] where M is the number of barriers. Step i spans from
  barrier[i] to barrier[i+1].

- **mesh_trackers**: Boolean array of length M. True means the step starting
  at that barrier still needs to be evaluated (or re-evaluated after splitting).

- **Batching**: When there are more steps than fit in GPU memory, the solver
  processes them in batches. Batch size is determined dynamically by measuring
  the memory footprint of the integrand function.

Class hierarchy (defined here):

- ``AdaptiveQuadrature``: Abstract base with the main integrate()
  loop, adaptive step management, error computation, and memory management.

- ``_UniformAdaptiveQuadratureBase``: Concrete subclass for methods with
  fixed tableau c values (quadrature points at constant fractional positions).

- ``_VariableAdaptiveQuadratureBase``: Concrete subclass for methods
  where quadrature points can be at arbitrary positions within each step.

    Base class for parallel adaptive-stepsize numerical integration.

    Implements the main integration loop that:

    2. Evaluates the integrand at quadrature points within each step (in batches).
    3. Computes integral contributions and error estimates per step using RK methods.
    4. Adaptively refines the mesh: splits high-error steps, merges low-error pairs.
    5. Repeats until all steps meet the error tolerance.
    6. Computes an optimal mesh for potential reuse.

        Perform parallel adaptive numerical integration of f.

        This is the main integration loop. It divides [mesh_init, mesh_final] into
        steps using barrier points, evaluates the integrand in parallel batches,
        and adaptively refines the mesh until all steps meet the error tolerance.

        The algorithm:
        1. Initialize barriers (random mesh or user-provided).
        2. While unevaluated steps remain:
           a. Select a batch of steps that fits in memory.
           b. Place C quadrature points in each step.
           c. Evaluate the integrand at all points in parallel.
           d. Compute integral contributions and error estimates via RK.
           e. Accept steps with error_ratio < 1; split the rest.
           f. Record accepted results.
        3. Optimize the final mesh (prune over-resolved + refine under-resolved).
        4. Return the integral, error, and diagnostics.

        Args:
            f: The integrand f(t). Takes shape [N, T], returns [N, D].
                If None, uses the function from construction.
            y0: Initial integral accumulator value. Shape: [D].
            mesh: Optional initial step barriers. If provided, these are the
                starting mesh. If None, a random mesh is generated. Shape: [N, T].
            mesh_init: Lower integration bound. Shape: [T].
            mesh_final: Upper integration bound. Shape: [T].
            N_init_steps: Approximate number of initial steps when mesh is None.
                The actual count is ~sqrt(N_init_steps) segments with
                ~sqrt(N_init_steps)+1 random sub-barriers each.
            f_args: Extra arguments passed to f.
            take_gradient: If True, calls loss.backward() after each batch
                to compute gradients through the integration.
            total_mem_usage: Fraction of memory to use for batching. Overrides
                the value from construction if provided.
            loss_fxn: Custom loss function. Takes an IntegrationResult, returns a
                scalar tensor. If None, uses the integral value itself.
            max_batch: Maximum evaluations per batch. Overrides dynamic memory
                calculation if provided.
            random_initial_mesh: When True (default), the fresh initial
                mesh is built with random sub-barrier offsets within each
                top-level segment. Randomness is essential here, not
                cosmetic: when the integrand has features at uniformly-
                spaced positions (e.g. zeros of ``sin(2*pi*k*t)``,
                polynomial extrema), an evenly-spaced mesh can align
                with those features in a way the adaptive controller
                cannot recover from. Random offsets break this
                alignment. Set to False only for debugging or for
                integrands you have separately verified to be safe
                against uniform-mesh aliasing; reproducibility is
                better achieved via ``torch.manual_seed`` before the
                call.
            reuse_mesh: When True, seed the integration from the optimal mesh
                cached by the previous successful call (warm start). Default
                False. The cached mesh is the *optimal* mesh produced after
                prune-and-refine on the previous call; reusing it across
                training-loop iterations where the integrand changes only
                slightly between calls saves substantial adaptive-refinement
                cost. If reuse_mesh=True but no cache exists, falls back to
                a fresh initial mesh and emits a warning. If the cached mesh
                was produced for a different integrand (id mismatch), emits
                a warning but proceeds. Ignored when ``mesh`` is provided
                explicitly (the explicit ``mesh`` always takes precedence).

        Returns:
            IntegrationResult with the computed integral, error estimates, the
            optimized mesh (mesh_optimal), per-step nodes, and diagnostics.

        Note:
            If mesh is provided, the solver uses these as initial barriers.
            Steps may be split or merged, but the bounds [mesh[0], mesh[-1]]
            are preserved. If mesh is None and reuse_mesh is False (default),
            a random initial mesh is generated in [mesh_init, mesh_final].

        For each step k::

        where ``cumsum[k]`` is the integral accumulated up to and
        including step k. As cumsum grows monotonically through the
        integration, the *denominator* grows, so the per-step

        applies a *tighter* tolerance to early steps when the running
        sum is still small.

        Empirical behavior (see tests/test_error_indicator.py):

          - For an integrand whose per-step error is constant and
            whose step values are positive, the per-step ratios
            decrease monotonically.
          - At the last step ``cumsum == integral``, so the ratio
            agrees with what the absolute mode produces for that step.

        Use this mode when you want the integrator to accept progressively
        larger absolute step errors as the integration progresses (i.e.,
        a fixed *relative* error against the running state). Use the
        absolute mode (``use_absolute_error_ratio=True``, the default)
        when you want a uniform-across-steps tolerance keyed to the
        total integral value — the better default for path integrals
