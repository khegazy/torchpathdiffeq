Variable-sampling adaptive quadrature: ``_VariableAdaptiveQuadratureBase``.

In variable sampling, quadrature points within each step can sit at
arbitrary positions; the b weights are recomputed dynamically from the
actual node positions via the method's ``tableau_b(c)`` callable.

This flexibility is what enables the variable solver's main
optimization: when an existing step is split into two sub-steps, the
old evaluation points end up at non-standard fractional positions
within the new sub-steps. The variable formula re-weights them
correctly so the old f-evaluations are reused, avoiding the redundant
recomputation that the uniform solver pays.

This intermediate base class holds the variable-specific overrides of
the abstract methods declared in ``AdaptiveQuadrature``. Concrete
solvers subclass this with a specific RK family for the
``_calculate_integral`` implementation.

    Parallel solver using variable-sampling Runge-Kutta methods.

    In variable sampling, quadrature points within each step can be at
    arbitrary positions (not fixed by the tableau). The b weights are
    computed dynamically based on the actual positions of the points via
    the method's ``tableau_b(c)`` function.

    This flexibility is especially useful during adaptive refinement: when
    a step is split, the existing evaluation points from the original step
    can be reused in the sub-steps (they just end up at different fractional
    positions within the new, smaller steps). This avoids redundant function
    evaluations.

    When merging two steps, the combined points are subsampled at evenly
    spaced indices to fit C points, and the b weights are recomputed for
    their new fractional positions.
