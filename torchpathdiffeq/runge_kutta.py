"""
Runge-Kutta integration solver implementations.

Provides concrete RK solver classes that implement the ``_calculate_integral()``
method from the parallel solver base classes. The core computation is the
RK weighted sum: integral = y0 + sum_over_steps(h * sum(b_i * f(t_i))).

Two solver variants:

- ``RKParallelUniformAdaptiveStepsizeSolver``: Uses fixed tableau b weights
  (same weights for every step). Faster since weights are precomputed.
- ``RKParallelVariableAdaptiveStepsizeSolver``: Computes tableau b weights
  dynamically from the actual quadrature point positions within each step.
  Necessary when mesh refinement places points at non-standard positions.

Both compute two estimates per step: the primary integral (using b weights)
and an error estimate (using b_error weights from the embedded lower-order
method). The error estimate drives the adaptive step refinement.

    Compute the Runge-Kutta weighted sum for a batch of integration steps.

    This is the core numerical operation: for each step, multiply the integrand
    evaluations by the tableau b weights, sum over the C quadrature points

    contributions to get the total integral.

    The formula per step i is:
