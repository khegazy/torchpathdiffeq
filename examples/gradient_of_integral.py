"""
gradient_of_integral.py — two equivalent ways to compute
``d/dtheta integrate(f_theta(t)) dt``.

The integration operator is linear in the integrand, so it commutes
with differentiation by a parameter that ``f`` depends on linearly.
This means there are two paths to the same answer:

  (A) Backprop through the integral.
      Just write ``f_theta(t)`` as a normal PyTorch callable that uses
      ``theta`` somewhere, run ``integrate(f_theta, ...)``, and call
      ``loss.backward()`` (or use the solver's ``take_gradient=True``).

  (B) Integrate ``df_theta/dtheta`` directly.
      You provide the closed-form derivative of the integrand with
      respect to ``theta`` and integrate that. Useful when ``f`` is
      expensive but its analytic gradient is cheap.

Both paths produce the same scalar gradient. This file demonstrates
agreement on a simple integrand ``f_theta(t) = theta * sin(t)`` over
``[0, pi]`` whose gradient is exactly 2.
